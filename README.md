# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for [swaywm](https://swaywm.org/) on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).

## Usage

Sway should be started from TTY with `runsway`, which will add some helpful environment variables.

## Installation

### Firefox

1. Install `firefox-user-autoconfig` from AUR.
2. Go to about:profiles and under Profile:default, click on Open Directory next to Root Directory.
3. Open a terminal at that location and run the following: `ln -s ../chrome
